# Torrent-To-Google-Drive-Multi-files
this apps is based on Torrent To Google Drive Downloader v4.1 but for this version we are gonna  use a file that contain a list of magnet link that will be downloaded


#Why 
I have created this to download multiple file 

#How
1 - First , you need to create a list of magnet link of file that you want to download
    NB : See exemple on file "MagnetList.json" and create a list as you want
2 - When you start the project on Colabs , use the create file by upload it when you start the 3rd part of code

#Thanks
